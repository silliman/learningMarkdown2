# Lab Access

You will be performing your lab from what we refer to as a *RHEL Jumpbox*.

You can *access* the lab guide from anywhere on the public Internet. Actually *performing* the lab from anywhere other than the *RHEL Jumpbox* is another matter altogether-  it can't be done for the following reasons.

1. The lab system is in the Washington Systems Center's (WSC) data center in Herndon, Virginia, USA, and is only accessible from the Internet via a VPN connection. The instructors have already logged the student jumpboxes into the WSC data center.

2. One unfortunate limitation of the jumpbox is that you cannot copy and paste from between the jumpbox browser window and other windows on your own laptop or workstation.  You are going to be doing a lot of copying and pasting in this lab.

Therefore you will have to open up Firefox in your jumpbox and access the lab from there.  We've set Firefox's home page in your jumpbox to the lab in order to make things easier for you.

Your instructors will provide the URL in the WebEx chat for you to use to sign in and reserve a jumpbox. They will also provide you with the password that you will need to be able to reserve a jumpbox.

So while we intend to always make the lab guide itself accessible to the public, actual access to the lab is restricted to students of our classes, and only for the duration of the class, as we reset the access credentials after each class.
